## About This Project
LuckAge is a post-flight experience app for SIA customers to use their waiting time for meaningful activities.

We focus on the post-flight experience of busy customers who want to do something meaningful while waiting for luggage or simply have them delivered so that they can focus their time on doing something important (attend meetings, going to tourist attractions).

The business value for this application is differentiation from other airlines because there are no existing airline services that focus on post-flight experience on collecting luggage. This will greatly increase customer satisfaction. Revenue stream comes in the form of add-on services such as luggage deliveries and sim card buying.
